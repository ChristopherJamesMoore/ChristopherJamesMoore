## Welcome! 👋🏼

I am [Christopher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-moore-1295a6228), an undergraduate student from the UK 🇬🇧 learning full-stack development.

My background combines industry experience in electronic engineering and embedded development with APL and my academic knowledge in software. This combination has given me a solid understanding of technologies and their implementations. I aim to work in a reputable software engineering department where I can collaborate with new people and learn and grow with my peers while developing well-built software solutions.

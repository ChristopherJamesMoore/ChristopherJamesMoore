## Welcome! 👋🏼

I am [Christopher](https://github.com/ChristopherJamesMoore), an undergraduate student from thr UK 🇬🇧 learning full-stack developemnt.

My combination of industry experience in electronic engineering and academic background in software have allowed me to form a robust understannding of technologies and their implementations. My future goal is to work in a large software eingineering department where I can meet new people and learn/ grow with my peers whilst developing well built software solutions!
